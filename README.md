# Detector reconstruction of $$\gamma$$-rays
This directory contains much of the Python code used in the bachelors thesis (https://odr.chalmers.se/handle/20.500.12380/301461?locale=sv), which was used as an interface for easily setting up custom designed neural networks, preprocessing training data and defining any kind loss function, all this to make lengthy parameter sweeps of any relevant hyper parameters (see eg. depth_width.py).

## Requirements
Python packages:
- tensorflow-gpu
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
